# Mine-vs-Rock-Detection
This project is a binary classification task using the Sonar dataset, which contains sonar signal returns from metal cylinders (mines) and rocks. The goal is to predict whether a given sonar reading corresponds to a mine or a rock using supervised machine learning algorithms.
